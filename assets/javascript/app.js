// initialize the .js document with this:
$( document ).ready(function() {
// need to click a button to start the game and the timer- onclick event
//timer counts down from 120 seconds
// a function/way to link buttons with correct answers to tabulate results
// need an incrementer for both correct, incorrect and unanswered questions
// maybe an if-else statement to tabulate them based on the correct answer
// guessed

// onclick events needed to tabulate results for each answer:
    $("").on("click", function (){
    });
