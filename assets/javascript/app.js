// initialize the .js document with this:
$( document ).ready(function() {
// need to click a button to start the game and the timer- onclick event
    $("").on("click", function (){
// when the start button clicked, the div with the questions that was hidden is shown
    });
//timer counts down from 120 seconds and stops game at 120 seconds

// a function/way to link buttons with correct answers to tabulate results

// need an incrementer for both correct, incorrect and unanswered questions

// maybe an if-else statement to tabulate them based on the correct answer
// guessed

// onclick events needed to tabulate results for each answer:
    $("").on("click", function (){
    });
